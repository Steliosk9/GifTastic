# GifTastic

Find your favorite animal Gif by Using the Giphy API! Every time that the user choose one of the preset button with an animal or search for an animal in the search bar a new button appears with the animal that we typed and the web page by Using the Giphy API generates 10 gifs at a time .

# How does it work?
The program uses ajax and jQuery to call the Giphy API. It then uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the page.
Initially, 10 buttons are displayed, each with a topic I have chosen.
The user can click on one of these buttons, or may choose to add their own button using the input field in the top-right of the screen and clicking 'Add'.
Upon clicking a button, 10 gifs will be genereated based on the topic. These gifs will be still images.
The user will see the rating of each gif and a download icon that they can use to download the image.
The images can be toggled to show or hide their animations by clicking on the images themselves.
Each time images are generated, they will be in groups of 10 and the most recent will be at the top of the page.
The page is also responsive and can be accessed via mobile, tablet or desktop.
